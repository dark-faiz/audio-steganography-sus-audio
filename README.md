Description
This project outlines an advanced voice steganography technique designed to support security enhancement in data with the integration of a double layer of encryption in audio files. The technique combines AES-256 encryption with LSB and secure hashing. This would result in a multi-layered framework that provides strong protection against unauthorized detection and access to such sensitive information while preserving very high-quality audio for such applications, which are designed to be secure and practicable.

Features
AES-256 Encryption : Sensitive data encrypted by AES-256 makes the data unreadable without proper decryption keys, in case exposed.
LSB Embedding : Encrypted data gets embedded in the audio signal using LSB manipulation and thus, maintaining the fidelity of the audio signal.
SHA Hashing : The embedding is followed by hashing as hashing provides a digital fingerprint in enhancing the security of integrity of data.
User-Friendly Interface: The steps of the encryption, embedding, and secondary hashing process are provided by the guided user interface.
Real-Time Audio Feedback: The users get real-time feedback on audio quality; hence, they can monitor the fidelity of the output.

Applications
The advanced steganographic technique in this project is apt for:
Secure messaging
Digital watermarking
Confidential data transmission
